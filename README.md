# Connect-Four-Game

The aim of this project is to implement the MINMAX-A-B algorithm and ALPHA-BETA-SEARCH ( from the TextBook “Artificial Intelligence – A Modern Approach” by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig ) by constructing a simple “Connect Four” Board game in C++ language. 
The game tests the implementation and performance of both the algorithms.
